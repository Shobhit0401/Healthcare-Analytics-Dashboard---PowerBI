# Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard---PowerBI

A powerful Power BI dashboard project for analyzing hospital operations and patient data, enhanced with AI-driven insights and GPT-style summaries. This project leverages real-world healthcare data to visualize performance metrics, patient outcomes, and departmental efficiency — and demonstrates how generative AI like ChatGPT can augment business intelligence by generating contextual explanations and executive summaries.
🔍 Key Features
📈 KPIs Monitoring: Total patients, admissions, discharges, ICU count, LOS, ER time, mortality, and revenue.
📊 Patient Demographics: Insights broken down by gender, age, and city.
📍 Geo-Analysis: Interactive map showing patient distribution across regions.
⏱️ LOS Breakdown: Analysis of average length of stay across age groups.
📤 Feedback & Experience: Patient satisfaction analysis by department and age.
🧠 AI + GPT Integration (Conceptual):
Auto-generated natural language summaries using ChatGPT (e.g., “ICU usage increased by 12% in Q3”).
GPT-based explanation of trends or anomalies in KPIs.
Chatbot interface concept for querying patient data insights in plain English.
🤖 AI Enhancement Example
Using GPT (ChatGPT or OpenAI API), this dashboard can be extended to:
Generate executive summaries dynamically based on filtered visuals.
Detect and highlight anomalies or unusual trends in ER wait times or LOS.
Enable natural language querying of the dataset (e.g., “Which department has the highest ER time?”).
Produce patient satisfaction narratives based on aggregated feedback.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop (Dashboard Development)
Power Query & DAX (Data Modeling & Measures)
Excel (Healthcare dataset)
OpenAI GPT API (Optional integration for insights & text generation)
